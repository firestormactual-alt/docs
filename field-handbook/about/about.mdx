        The Task Force Hightower Field Handbook (FH) acts as a complete guide to the standards operating procedures, principles, and strategies utilized in the operations and management of TFH. The FH is designed for use by all individuals in the task force and aims to cover the entirety of the TFH's principles of operation.

      <Accordion title="FH/GB-02 - Chapters and Subchapters" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        Chapters mark large segments of the FH, keeping general concepts together. Subchapters mark chunks of generally related information that fit under the theme of a larger chapter. Each chapter is given a reference code in the format **FH/CXX** . Subchapters are referenced in the format **FH/CXX.X** .
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/GB-03 - Groups" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        A layer below chapters and subchapters, groups contain connected blocks that make sense positioned together. All blocks in a group are related to an overarching theme for the group. Groups are given reference IDs in the format **FH/GXX** and are numbered irrespectively of chapters and subchapters.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/GB-04 - Guide Blocks" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        Guides constitute recommended methods and advice on subject matters. They do not represent enforced policies, but rather explanations, knowledge, and context considered valuable for a given subject. They are designated by a book symbol (as seen here: <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} />; use size 13). Guide Blocks are given IDs in the format of <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-X**.

        All Blocks are based on a universal numbering system based on order of appearance. For instance, <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-01** and <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-02** would be sequential; <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-02** would, in this scenario, not exist. References are marked as <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-X** with a link to their reference point.

        Guide Blocks are mostly text-based, not image-based. They are not required information but are heavily encouraged for a better understanding of a subject. They are considered best practice and not subject to standardization or enforcement.

      <Accordion title="FH/GB-05 - Policy Blocks" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        Policies are standards and regulations that constitute the overarching framework of the FH. They establish requirements and beliefs held standard across the force, and are enforced for strict compliance at all levels of leadership. They are designated by a gavel symbol (as seen here: <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} />; use size 13). Policy Blocks are given IDs in the format of <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-X**.

        All Blocks are based on a universal numbering system based on order of appearance. For instance, <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-01** and <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-02** would be sequential; <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-02** would, in this scenario, not exist. References are marked as <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-X** with a link to their reference point.

        Policies are designed to be easily understandable, clear, and formally authorized in accordance with **[INSERT POLICY HERE]**. They are mandatory to follow and enforced as detailed **[HERE]**.

      <Accordion title="FH/GB-06 - Skill Blocks" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        Skill Blocks detail essential skills for use in TFH operations. They are designed to help teach capabilities to Hightower personnel to aid them in the performance of their duties. Skills are desgined to be tested and evaluated by peers to aid in the learning and development of crucial capabilities. They are designated by a graduation-cap symbol (as seen here: <Icon icon="graduation-cap" iconType="solid" size={13} />; use size 13). Skill Blocks are given IDs in the format of <Icon icon="graduation-cap" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/SB-X**.

        All Blocks are based on a universal numbering system based on order of appearance. For instance, <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-01** and <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-02** would be sequential; <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-02** would, in this scenario, not exist. References are marked as <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-X** with a link to their reference point.

        Skills should be given actionable names. An example would be "Call in a 9-line MEDEVAC Request." They should use bullet points instead of full text whenever possible to condese information. They should be written imperatively without third-person or direct second-person references. An example of a good instruction is "Wait for further instructions," and not "You should wait for further instructions" or "Trainees should wait for further instructions." Skills should be well-defined and measurable. They should have a desired end state for personnel to achieve. Skills are utilized as learning tools and are overseen by authorized Task Force Hightower Cadre who are approved to teach the given skill.

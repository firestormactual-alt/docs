As an experienced organization in the Platinum Five community, we seek to provide a unique and rewarding experience for all members. We have members across several continents, including multiple in the armed forces of their respective countries. Our minimum age is 14.

        Task Force Hightower seeks to balance a mixture of real-world Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) with in-game functionality. We develop custom maps and operations to give our members the best experience possible through realistic combat and platform-specific alterations. We believe in replication of the real world, specifically to the point where it makes sense for us. Extraneous things like virtual PT and screaming are not helpful, so we avoid them.

      <Accordion title="FH/GB-10 - Deployments" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        Hightower operates without a rigid schedule. We allow members to sign up for events whenever they can, and make accomodations for those who cannot make them. Our current minimum activity requirement for most members is one operation and one training per two-week cycle, but this is subject to change as updates are made.

        We use a Modular Role System based on skills to determine our deployment ORBATs. While our command ORBATs are based on unit, deployment ORBATs are created in a multiple step process per deployment. The event host/command staff determine a template for the ORBAT, and individuals sign up for a slot based on their skill sets and capabilities. Priority slots for a role are granted based on an individual's capabilities and 

        Event listings for a given week are typically posted on Sundays. If a event list is not posted, all activity requirements are considered waived for that two-week cycle. Event listings will include the type of event and the time it will be hosted, as well as who is responsible for it.

        Joining Task Force Hightower is a simple but sophisticated process to ensure our members are capable and competent. The current admission process includes unit application, Initial Entry Training, and application for a clearance depending on your position.

        **Task Force Application:** Submit a fully filled copy of the HDD-4 Enlistment Form in the [#application-submission](https://discord.com/channels/1358550750946398289/1427100420022599811) channel. This form includes your Name, Discord ID, Enlistment Option, Entry Rank, MOS, and other applicable details.

        **Unit Application (for those seeking a SOF position):** Select the unit you wish to join and submit their application in the [#application-submission](https://discord.com/channels/1358550750946398289/1427100420022599811) channel. Each unit has their own requirements and standards, but we generally request that you type in clear and complete English sentences. Formality and professionalism go a long way in shaping your application.

        **Initial Entry Training:** Once your application is reviewed and accepted, you will attend an initial training. This training is comprised of Basic Combat Training, plus additional training for your desired MOS. You are not limited to this MOS only in operations; this simply grants you training for a desired job straight out of the gate. Applicants seeking a Commissioned Officer or Warrant Officer position will also attend the Infantry Basic Officer Leadership Course (may be done in leiu of BCT), Officer Candidate School, or Warrant Officer Candidate School.

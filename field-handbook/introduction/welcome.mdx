    Ranger Expeditionary Task Force Hightower, more commonly called Task Force Hightower (or TFH for short), is a BRM5-focused milsim faction created in April of 2025. As an experienced organization in the Platinum Five community, we seek to provide a unique and rewarding experience for all members. We have members across several continents, including multiple in the armed forces of their respective countries. Our minimum age is 14. Task Force Hightower is home to a variety of skill sets and capabilities, and offers a broad range of opportunities for progression and development.

  <Accordion title="FH/GB-09 - What MILSIM Means to Us" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    Task Force Hightower seeks to balance a mixture of real-world Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) with in-game functionality. We develop custom maps and operations to give our members the best experience possible through realistic combat and platform-specific alterations. We believe in replication of the real world, specifically to the point where it makes sense for us. Extraneous things like virtual PT and screaming are not helpful, so we avoid them.

  <Accordion title="FH/GB-10 - Deployments" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    Hightower operates without a rigid schedule. We allow members to sign up for events whenever they can, and make accomodations for those who cannot make them. Our current minimum activity requirement for most members is one operation and one training per two-week cycle, but this is subject to change as updates are made.

    We use a Modular Role System based on skills to determine our deployment ORBATs. While our command ORBATs are based on unit, deployment ORBATs are created in a multiple step process per deployment. The event host/command staff determine a template for the ORBAT, and individuals sign up for a slot based on their skill sets and capabilities. 

    Event listings for a given week are typically posted on Sundays. If a event list is not posted, all activity requirements are considered waived for that two-week cycle. Event listings will include the type of event and the time it will be hosted, as well as who is responsible for it.

    Joining Task Force Hightower is a simple but sophisticated process to ensure our members are capable and competent. The current admission process includes unit application, Initial Entry Training, and application for a clearance depending on your position.

    Unit Application: Select the unit you wish to join, FUCCCKKKKKKKK

    Application: Start your journey with UNITAF by submitting a detailed application. Highlight your interests, skills, and what makes you a perfect fit for our unit. We look for individuals who are team-oriented and enthusiastic about military simulation.

    Orientation: Once your application is reviewed and accepted, you will embark on orientation. This orientation is designed to align you with UNITAF's values, operational systems and expectations. The self-induction video series will provide you with essential information about our unit, its structure, and how we operate. During this phase, you will have access to dedicated chat channels on Discord where you can ask questions and interact with other applicants and candidates.

    Acceptance: Upon successful completion of the orientation process, you will be formally accepted into UNITAF's ranks as a candidate. At this stage, you will be given the freedom to select roles and participate in operations that match your skills and interests. Our non-fixed ORBAT system empowers you to explore different roles and teams in each deployment, ensuring a diverse and engaging experience.

  <Accordion title="FH/PB-29 - Article 2: Respectful Conduct" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
    Task Force Hightower recruits from around the globe, from all demographics. Some of our members have been around for a while and have raport with each other. These members may engage in conversation that, out of context, may seem rude or irrational. If you are a new member and questioning whether a given statement is disrespectful, err on the side of caution. We do, however, have certain quasi-banned topics of within the task force. These include:

    - race/background
    - religion/belief
    - sexuality
    - politics of any kind (excluding military subjects)

    Quasi-banned subjects are to be approached with great caution. Do not bring up derogatory, explicit, or inflamatory subjects under any circumstances. This applies to gifs, photos, videos, links, and any other form of media.

    - Is conducted in the Hightower name
    - Is conducted while using our uniforms and TTPs

    You are also forbidden from poaching members from Hightower (inviting friends/those already interested is fine, but hostile intent as determined by UNICOM+ will be dealt with accordingly).

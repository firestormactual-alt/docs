      <Accordion title="FH/PB-34 - Activity Policy: Regular, Reserve, and Inactive Status" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Hightower personnel are required to maintain an activity status to facilitate global immediate response and rapid deployment capabilities. The standard activity statuses are Active Duty and Reserve. A desired activity status MUST be requested and approved before it is safe to assume it applies to you; the appropriate status must be listed in your roles and on the roster to count as valid. The requirements for these statuses are as follows:

        | MINIMUMS                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

        Failure to meet these requirements for an extended period of time as determined by UNICOM is sufficient grounds to mark a member as Inactive.

        Active Duty personnel are eligible for shifting roles under the Modular Role System, and may execute mission in any MOS they meet the criteria for. They promote on a standard track, and comprise the majority of Task Force Hightower.

        Reserve personnel are ineligible for the Modular Role System, and may only execute missions using their Declared MOS. In addition, they require twice the time duration for eligibility for any promotion.

        Inactive personnel are kept in the Discord server for administrative purposes for a period of up to 90 days. During this time, they may request reactivation or request copies of their files. After this time, or pending failure to respond for an activity check, TASCOM reserves the right to remove an Inactive member.

        The Task Force Commanding Officer and Executive Officer may be held by Active Duty members only.

      <Accordion title="FH/PB-35 - Return from Inactive Status" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        In order to return to Active Duty or Reserve status, members must fill out a Return to Status form containing the following information:

        - Name
        - Rank
        - Discord ID
        - Previous Duty Status
        - Reason for Sudden Inactivity

        This form must be submitted to your chain of command within 90 days of being marked Inactive. UNICOM will then, assuming the form is approved by your command, open a ticket to discuss the matter further. Pending UNICOM approval, you may return to your previous status with no reduction in rank or other punitive measures. If UNICOM determines your inactivity to be due to negligence or other faulty behavior, administrative action may be taken.

        If your request is denied at any phase of the process, you may request a Joint Personnel Information Record (JPIR) be filled out for you. After you recieve this document and indicate your intention to discharge to your chain of command, you may reenlist.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/PB-36 - Leave of Abscence System" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Task Force Hightower has an extremely easy to navigate Leave of Abscence system. We allow this for any number of reasons for periods of up to one month without waiver. After returning from LOA, you must wait a duration of time equal to your LOA to apply waiver-free for another one. Durations of a month or longer or applications within the cooldown window require UNICOM approval.

        Members on Leave are kept on normal duty status but have waived responsibilities for all cycles that their Leave covers. Members who are LOA are not permitted to host or attend operations without UNICOM approval. Time on LOA does not count towards promotion eligibility. 

        To apply for a Leave of Abscence, fill out and submit the Leave of Abscence request form.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/PB-37 - Discharges" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Members may at any point apply for a discharge from Task Force Hightower. The discharge process includes informing your chain of command, requesting your documents from J1 (and J2 as applicable) to include your interim JPIR and any Discord personnel files, and submitting a Final Discharge Packet to UNICOM. UNICOM will then determine your discharge type and return a final copy of the JPIR. 

        The Discharge types are divided into Administrative, Punitive, and Separation. Administrative discharges may be voluntary or involuntary. The Administrative Discharges are:

        - Honorable Discharge
          - Fulfilled their assigned job in a diligent and competent manner, followed the rules, and obeyed the Handbook and the Hightower UCMJ
          - A letter of reprimand or other minor infraction usually does not prevent a member from leaving with an Honorable Discharge
          - Eligible for reenlistment with additional bonuses
        - General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions)
          - Some sort of event or thing prevented the member from performing their job adequately or from meeting expected standards of conduct
          - Eligible for reenlistment
        - Other than Honorable Discharge
          - Used when the member’s conduct results in punishment for violation of the Hightower UCMJ. Security violations, assault, abuse of authority, and drug violations are all examples of the type of conduct warranting an Other Than Honorable Discharge
          - Not typically eligible for reenlistment

        Punitive Discharges require a Court Martial's authority. The Punitive Discharge types are:

        - Bad Conduct Discharge
          - Handed down for offenses that warrant removal under the Hightower UCMJ
          - Not eligible for reenlistment
        - Dishonorable Discharge
          - Handed down for the worst offenses
          - Not eligible for reenlistment
          - Hightower J2 will inform all allies and affiliates of Dishonorable Discharge proceedings
            - Task Force Hightower members have a duty to report members who have been issued Dishonorable Discharges to the command staff of any faction they see them in and inform them of the reason why they were discharged

        Separations are issued for special purposes outside the normal discharge scopes. Hightower currently only recognizes one Separation category:

        - Entry-Level Separation
          - Given to members who were unable to complete basic training, unable to meet standards, or unwilling to complete training. The recipient is a new recruit who has been in the task force for less than 7 days and has received written notifications recommending ways they may improve their behavior or performance.
          - Eligible for reenlistment

        Members may request a discharge at any time. Personnel who have made a significant impact on Hightower or its subordinate units may apply for retirement. Retired members must have no outstanding gross conduct violations. Determination for retired status is made by UNICOM on an individual basis. Retired personnel retain access to most Task Force Hightower systems and services and may participate in Hightower events. Retired personnel are not held to an activity standard, but are held to the same skill standards for participation in events. Retired personnel have "Ret. " placed before their rank in their name.

        Applicable services may include:

        - The Task Force SecureNet
        - Certain Controlled Access Programs
        - Hightower J2 updates
        - The Hightower RGE map
        - Other digital services

        Members who do not meet the requirements for retirement may still retain access to certain Hightower services under the veteran designation. Veterans must have received an Honorable or General Discharge and have no major outstanding violations. Determination for this status is made by UNICOM on an individual basis. Veteran personnel may retain access to specific services on a case by case basis. Veterans are not permitted to attend operations. Veterans may attend internal trainings, but must meet the required skill standards for any given event. Veterans are marked by a "Fmr. " before their rank.

      <Accordion title="FH/PB-38 - Prescence" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        All members of Task Force Hightower are required to stay in both the main Hightower server and the SecureNet server, even if they are not granted a clearance. Leaving any of these servers without notifying J1 (for the main server) or J2 (for the SecureNet) is considered grounds for removal from the other. In a case such as this, the normal discharge process is waived and all administrative information about a member may be irrecoverably deleted. No guarantee of enlistment eligibility or bonuses are made in such a case. Disciplinary information is always retained for security purposes.

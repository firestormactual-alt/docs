  <Accordion title="FH/PB-34 - Activity Policy: Regular, Reserve, and Inactive Status" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
    Hightower personnel are required to maintain an activity status to facilitate global immediate response and rapid deployment capabilities. The standard activity statuses are Active Duty and Reserve. A desired activity status MUST be requested and approved before it is safe to assume it applies to you; the appropriate status must be listed in your roles and on the roster to count as valid. The requirements for these statuses are as follows:

    | MINIMUMS                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

    Failure to meet these requirements for an extended period of time as determined by UNICOM is sufficient grounds to mark a member as Inactive.

    Active Duty personnel are eligible for shifting roles under the Modular Role System, and may execute mission in any MOS they meet the criteria for. They promote on a standard track, and comprise the majority of Task Force Hightower.

    Reserve personnel are ineligible for the Modular Role System, and may only execute missions using their Declared MOS. In addition, they require twice the time duration for eligibility for any promotion.

    Inactive personnel are kept in the Discord server for administrative purposes for a period of up to 90 days. During this time, they may request reactivation or request copies of their files. After this time, or pending failure to respond for an activity check, TASCOM reserves the right to remove an Inactive member.

    The Task Force Commanding Officer and Executive Officer may be held by Active Duty members only.

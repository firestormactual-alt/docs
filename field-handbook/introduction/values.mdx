  <Accordion title="FH/G03 - The Warrior Ethos" defaultOpen>
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="FH/PB-12 - I will always place the mission first" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        The first of the four tenets of the Warrior Ethos, loyalty to the mission is critical to success. If we deprioritize the mission, we grant ourselves the authority to shirk responsibilities and operate sloppily. Thusly, we will always put priority on the mission over side tasks or individual goals when in an operation. (This obviously changes a little outside of operations; we want to prioritize the real world too).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/PB-13 - I will never accept defeat" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        The second tenet of the Warrior Ethos, we will never accept defeat under any circumstances. We may lose a fight, we may make mistakes, and we may even face surrender under an overwhelming force, but we will never accept defeat. We will fight bitterly even when victory seems impossible. Failure is not an option, it is a certainty. What defines a warrior is the choice to keep trying despite failure.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/PB-14 - I will never quit" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Similar to the second tenet, the third part of the Warrior Ethos is just as critical. Giving up is never an option. To quit is to accept defeat; to accept defeat is a violation. Regardless of circumstances, we will continue the battle until it is finished.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/PB-15 - I will never leave a fallen comrade" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        To abandon a comrade is tantamount to fratricide. Even if it seems a comrade is incapable of completing the mission, or is unskilled, or injured, your priority is to fight alongside them. If they cannot fight, your job is to get them to safety. Anything less is nothing short of dishonorable.

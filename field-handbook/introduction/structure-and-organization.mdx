This command is comprised of all current and former commanders of Hightower units, as well as the Task Force Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, and Chief of Staff. TASCOM is automatically granted the Server Management Team role. This role may only be revoked in conjunction with removal from TASCOM. Removal of such is reserved for grave circumstances.
    - UNICOM is comprised of all unit leadership. This includes TASCOM, top-line 2ICs, and all commissioned officers. UNICOM handles a majority of Hightower operations and sensitive procedures. UNICOM is automatically granted the Moderator role. This role may only be revoked in conjunction with removal from UNICOM. Removal of such is reserved for grave circumstances.
    - The NCO corps is comprised of all noncommissioned and warrant officers. The NCO corps is responsible for maintenence of unit health and cohesion, training, and standards enforcement.

Certain high-level Staff leadership may be granted TASCOM access on an individual basis as determined by existing TASCOM members.

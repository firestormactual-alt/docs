  <Accordion title="FH/GB-01 - Purpose and Scope" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    The Task Force Hightower Field Handbook (FH) acts as a complete guide to the standards operating procedures, principles, and strategies utilized in the operations and management of TFH. The FH is designed for use by all individuals in the task force and aims to cover the entirety of the TFH's principles of operation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FH/GB-02 - Chapters and Subchapters" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    Chapters mark large segments of the FH, keeping general concepts together. Subchapters mark chunks of generally related information that fit under the theme of a larger chapter. Each chapter is given a reference code in the format**FH/CXX** . Subchapters are referenced in the format**FH/CXX.X** .
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FH/GB-03 - Groups" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    A layer below chapters and subchapters, groups contain connected blocks that make sense positioned together. All blocks in a group are related to an overarching theme for the group. Groups are given reference IDs in the format **FH/GXX** and are numbered irrespectively of chapters and subchapters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FH/GB-04 - Guide Blocks" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    Guides constitute recommended methods and advice on subject matters. They do not represent enforced policies, but rather explanations, knowledge, and context considered valuable for a given subject. They are designated by a book symbol (as seen here: <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} />; use size 13). Guide Blocks are given IDs in the format of <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-X**.

    All Blocks are based on a universal numbering system based on order of appearance. For instance, <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-01** and <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-02** would be sequential; <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-02** would, in this scenario, not exist. References are marked as <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-X** with a link to their reference point.

    Guide Blocks are mostly text-based, not image-based. They are not required information but are heavily encouraged for a better understanding of a subject. They are considered best practice and not subject to standardization or enforcement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FH/GB-05 - Policy Blocks" icon="book" iconType="solid">
    Policies are standards and regulations that constitute the overarching framework of the FH. They establish requirements and beliefs held standard across the force, and are enforced for strict compliance at all levels of leadership. They are designated by a gavel symbol (as seen here: <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} />; use size 13). Policy Blocks are given IDs in the format of <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-X**.

    All Blocks are based on a universal numbering system based on order of appearance. For instance, <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-01** and <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-02** would be sequential; <Icon icon="book" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/GB-02** would, in this scenario, not exist. References are marked as <Icon icon="gavel" iconType="solid" size={13} /> **FH/PB-X** with a link to their reference point.

    Policies are designed to be easily understandable, clear, and formally authorized in accordance with **[INSERT POLICY HERE]**. They are mandatory to follow and enforced as detailed\*\*[HERE]\*\* .

Skill Blocks detail essential skills for use in TFH operations. They are designed to help teach capabilities to Hightower personnel to aid them in the performance of their duties. Skills are desgined to be tested and evaluated by peers

Each skill outlined in the Force Manual is actionable and evaluable, focused on demonstrable proficiency. Unlike Policies, Skill development and assessment is designed for peer-to-peer (P2P) evaluation, for continuous skill improvement, feedback, and shared learning within the unit. Skill Blocks are focused on developing practical expertise. 

**Skill Blocks:**

- **Have an imperative title:** Should have a title written as an imperative, in the form of: "Do action (to achieve this result)". Example: "Communicate Effectively (to coordinate fire support)".
- **Use imperative and direct language:** Should be written in an imperative style, without directly addressing the reader in the second person (e.g., "you") or using third-person address. Example: "Maintain situational awareness." not "You must maintain situational awareness." or "Members should maintain situational awareness."
- **Are clearly formatted:** Should primarily use bullet points instead of full sentences wherever possible for conciseness and readability.
- \*\*Are defined: \*\*Should not cover abstract concepts but focus on well-defined, observable skills that can be evaluated and trained.
- **State desired outcomes:** Should clearly state the desired outcome or purpose of performing the skill.

\*\*Interpretation: \*\*Should be considered “competency guides” designed for learning and peer evaluation.

\*\*Enforcement: \*\*Skills are monitored, trained and enforced by the Training Teams who oversee the Combat Areas to which the skills relate.

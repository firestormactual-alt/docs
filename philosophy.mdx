    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="FH/BP-2211 - Excellence is demonstrable" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        We aim to embody excellence. We demonstrate this through competency under pressure, precision in preparation, and capability under fire.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/BP-2212 - Immersion supports readiness" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        By creating an immersive environment, we are better prepared to use real world tactics and doctrine in our operations. We focus on realism where it is helpful and applicable, and simplicity where full realism is unwieldy or excessive.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/BP-2213 - Respect is fundamental" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        We believe respect is fundamentally important to good relations. It is automatic until it is violated, and it is restored and improved through effort.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/BP-2214 - Integrity and loyalty" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Personal integrity comes before loyalty, and loyalty follow integrity without exception. Without integrity or loyalty, there can be no trust. Trust is integral.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/BP-2215 - Balance sustains excellence" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Commitment to the group is important, but so is the real world. Disregarding the group results in decay; disregarding the real world results in a variety of long-term ills. Balance must be struck.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="FH/BP-2216 - Real world takes precedence" icon="gavel" iconType="solid">
        Obligations, health, and safety beyond operations take priority. Don't miss on time with your family, a needed break, or catching up on sleep simply to maintain attendance. Such behavior is unhealthy — at the end of the day, this is all just a game.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    These beliefs represent the foundation of our organization. We seek to demonstrate excellence, respect, integrity, loyalty, and balance, all while maintaining a fun and immersive environment.

⸻ Philosophy I — CHALL Values We measure ourselves by five traits. You can’t fake them. Principles:

1. Communication: factual, timely, reliable. Leave no doubt. 2. Humility: know your limits; admit your mistakes; never assume superiority., 3. Assertiveness: take action when needed; defer when required; lead by example., 4. Likeability: earn trust; build cohesion; respect fosters morale., 5. Lethality: technical proficiency, mental discipline, and decisive action.,

Philosophy II — Brotherhood and Duty We are tightly bound — by shared hardship, shared goals, shared responsibility. Principles:

1. Mutual defense: we cover each other’s blind spots, inside and outside operations. 2. Communal burden: joy, loss, stress — we hold and share them., 3. Knowledge is duty: every member teaches, every member learns., 4. Rank does not override respect: from senior leaders to new members, dignity is due., 5. Commitment to the brotherhood persists beyond missions.,

   ,

⸻ Philosophy III — Operational Professionalism We prepare with discipline; we act with precision. Principles:

1. Stealth until decisive; control tempo. 2. Plan from first principle; execute with resolve., 3. Communication is command; failure of comms is failure of mission., 4. Debrief rigorously — learn what happened, why it happened, and what we change., 5. Flexibility under fire; adapt without sacrificing core objectives.,

   ,

⸻ Philosophy IV — Culture of Equilibrium We maintain high standards without losing ourselves. Principles:

1. Take the mission seriously; treat yourself humanly. 2. Discipline without coldness; leadership without tyranny., 3. Humor is accepted; arrogance is not., 4. Persistence matters; quitting is never the plan., 5. Silence used well — in planning, reflection, and restraint.,

   ,

⸻ Philosophy V — Ethics and Real-World Values How we act outside the firefight defines who we are in it. Principles:

1. Adherence to rules of engagement — fairness, accountability, honor. 2. Honesty in all matters — internal and external., 3. Duty to protect sensitive information and respect privacy., 4. Real life outranks simulation — wellbeing, obligations, personal integrity., 5. Strength is hollow without compassion — a good unit lifts its members, not just its victories.,

    **Guide Blocks:**

    - **Are mostly comprised of text.** Don't make a guide block of just pictures.
    - **Are complimentary.** They offer context, techniques, explanations, and other helpful but nonessential knowledge.

    They are to be taken as**recommendations and advice** .

    They are**not mandatory or enforced** .

  <Accordion title="New Accordion">
    Policies are hard and fast rules that are critical to our operations and the Handbook. They establish mandatory action, standards, and behaviors for our Warriors. They are non-negotiable. Policies are enforced by all levels of leadership and are monitored for strict compliance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="New Accordion">
    Policies are immutable rules and regulations that are integral to the Force Manual. They firmly establish UNITAF's mandatory standards, shaping member actions, behaviours, and the overall operational ethos. Policies define the non-negotiable boundaries and requirements. Policies are enforced by Unit Command to ensure consistent adherence to established standards and maintain order and structure within UNITAF operations and member conduct. 

    **Policy Blocks:**

    - **Are easily interpreted:** Content should not have a steep learning curve and be readily understandable.
    - **Are actionable and unambiguous:** Should be written in a manner where it is easy to objectively determine whether an action contrary to the policy has occurred or not, with a clearly defined scope of application.
    - **Are approved:** Should only contain content that has been formally agreed upon in accordance with [FM/G171 - Part 5: Philosophy of Doctrine Change](https://beta.unitedtaskforce.net/handbook/group/171/part-5-philosophy-of-doctrine-change), as breaches of policies are usually investigated.

    **Interpretation: **Should be considered “must-follow rules” that are officially enforced.

    **Enforcement: **Policies are enforced by Unit Command via Personnel Command, as outlined in [FM/BP-225 - Article 1: Code of Conduct](https://beta.unitedtaskforce.net/handbook/block/225/article-1-code-of-conduct) and [FM/BP-255 - Violations of the Code of Conduct](https://beta.unitedtaskforce.net/handbook/block/255/violations-of-the-code-of-conduct).
